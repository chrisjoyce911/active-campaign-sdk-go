# Example generated constants

This folder contains a small example `active/constants.go` file that mirrors
the output of `genconstants`. It's intended as a documentation and test
fixture â€” you can use it to show the exact shape of the generated output in
README docs or unit tests.

The file `active/constants.go` includes sample `Tags`, `Lists` and `Fields`
structs with corresponding `ByID` reverse maps.
